### GradientExtractorFX

- Requires Java 8

Run with:

    ./gradlew run

Then, click `Load Image`, and drag a line across it to generate a JavaFX css linear gradient

### Known Issues

- Sometimes gets the colors wrong (get color abberation esp on diagonal drag lines)
- Sometimes misses peaks, so color steps are missing

### TODO

I think sub-pixel accuracy would improve both of these
